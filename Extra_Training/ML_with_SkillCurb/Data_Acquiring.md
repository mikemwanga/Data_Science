# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Data Acquisition
This is finding data for machine learning

Requires three approaches
1. Data discovery (gathered, combined and analysed)
2. Data augmentation 
3. Data Generation

Challenges in Data collection

1. Data volume, how much data is enough?
2. Data presentation
3. Variety of data
4. Data accuracy
5. Procuring data
6. Data permissions - ethical considerations

Data sources include, google dataset, kaggle, .gov datasets, fivethirtyeight etc

Data preparation steps as below

![data_preparation]()

Data formats include, csv, xlxs, txt, json etc.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Skill to explore and gain insights of the datasets. Get an idea for the processing the data and hypothesis. This might require
help of statistical tools in python. 
Identify 'predictor' and 'target' variables in the dataset. What data types ad which category for each data type.

Analyse univariate values on the data. Understand the spread of the variable and the ranges. How many males and how many females?


Perform bivariate analysis by checking relationships, correlation, association, dissociation

Check presence of missing values and outliers.


## EDA by Data Visualisation
Multiple plots can be used to have a Visualisation of the datasets. Plotyl, ggplot2, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas,

## Data Cleaning

Important to identify missing values.

Boxplots and histograms and scatterplots can be used to visually inspect outliers.
