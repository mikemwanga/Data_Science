## Process & Workflow.
1. Collect Data
2. Clean and Transform data
3. Explore and visualize
4. Fit model
5. Evaluate model
6. Deploy

Data visualisation provides insights in data trends to check any imbalances in the data <br>

A model identifies trends and patterns in the data that is input to any machine learning algorithm <br>

Evaluations allows us to check accuracy of the model on new datasets. Once this is done. Models is deployed.

## Machine Learning Types

#### Supervised Learning - makes use of label data to train model. Accuracy requires more data.
	Types
	**Classification** - prediction to which category data belongs. Classification can be binary or multibinary.
	Mail can be sparm or not, load approaved or not. Disease or not  diseased
	
	**Regression** - outcome in countinous value rather than discrete. Response is a dependet variable while
	outcomes are independent variables. Example prediction of house prices, car prices, body weight which
	are all in terms of countinous values.

#### Unsupervised Learning - makes use of unlabelled data 
	Data Driven, no label trained data. Uses features of data
	E.g recommender system in Youtube or Netflix.
	
	Types
	**Clustering** - data grouped based on similarities based on pattern in the data points. e.g group 
	customers based on shopping behaviour
	

#### Reinforcement learning - the computer learns on its own from the data
	based on Trial and error, example learning to walk. Learn to crawl, stand still then make steps.

	Types
	**Positive Reinforcement** - promotes behaviour by rewarding
	**Negative Reinforcement**  - promotes behaviour by avoinding negative consequences.
	
	Examples
	-GPS, Robotics
	
#### Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
	Type of machine learning that simulates natural human biological process. eg how the brain functions.
	
	[ANN](add image)
	e.g handwriting recognition, image compression, travel salesman problem, text to speech, stock exchange prediction
	
	
### Types of ML Models - Supervised ML

#### Regression 
	makes prediction based on relationship between dependent and independent variable. e.g linear,
	polynomial, decision tree,random forest, logistic Regression
#### Linear Regression
	Prediction of dependent variable (y) based on independent variable (x). X is the input data while Y is the features associated to Y
#### Logistic Regression
	Used in problems where predicted output is categorical. i.e predict whether student will pass or fail, email is sparm or not, test is positive or negative
	
#### Nearest Neighbour 
	Based on assumptoin that similar things lie close within space.	Used  in both classificatio and regression problems. Makes use of KNN classifiers. Animals that
	resemble cat will be categorised based on their similarities.

#### Decision Tree
	Makes use of decision tree. e.g whether a coin returns a head or tail.

### Types of ML Models - Supervised ML

#### K-Mean
	Classifiies based on means of data points. Degree to belonging to a cluster is based on the distance from the centroid

	
### Types of ML Models - Reinforcement learning
#### Q-learning
